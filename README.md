# Facebook-Messenger-Bot

This is a simple messenger bot witht he purpose of sending jokes to people who may feel bored or depressed during COVID-19 crisis.
I used ```Node.JS``` , ```Express``` as primary techoogy for the App, and ```Mongo DB``` as database.

## Local deploment
You must have ```npm``` installed PC
Have ```Mongo``` installed on your PC
You can use whichiver ```text editor```, I used [Visual Studio] but it's up to what you prefer most.

one you are all set:

Run ```node server.js``` command to start the App.
If you get an error for a missage librariy, install it first by running ```npm install [libraryName].```
